    "Most of our other services end up having to call the api day-by-day to make sure that we get all of the events. This service proposes collecting the event data in a normalized format for all sports (The ESPN API already does a great job of this)\n",
    "we are just going to wrap the api call into a typed class in the espn-api-orm, make scheduled calls to that ORM and store the responses from that endpoint here.\n",
